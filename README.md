# JavaScriptCoding
The repo contains JavaScript coding questions with their solutions.
I will be adding questions as and when I encounter them and solve them. 
These questions can be helpful to anyone looking to hone their JavaScript skill.
This repository will also be helpful for those looking for an opportunity in a Product based company as a JavaScript/UI developer. Majority of these companies conduct a coding round with coding difficulty level similar to the questions solved here.

Also, I will appreciate if someone comes up with a better solution to the answers that I have posted, then he/she can go ahead and raise a PR with proper explaination as to why the solution is better. It would help me document the soilutions better for others.
